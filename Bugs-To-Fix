Title: RFKILL Boot Killer
Urgency: HIGH
Desc: systemd-rfkill.service seems to slow the boot time to over 20
minutes in some tests.

Notes:
- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/227017/how-to-change-systemd-service-timeout-value
  - From Alex from BigDaddyLinux Discord Server
- On next developer build, if still an issue, talk to ItzSwirlz to see if he does it different

Title: Boot Editing TTY
Urgency: Medium
Desc: Editing the boot params/using manual verification boots into
terminal instead of LuminaDE, otherwise should work fine
--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Level: URGENT
Description: A login bug, LightDM will appear instead of the desktop, 
     and logging in through that might not work, and you will boot to 
     a black screen, not Lumina.
Hypothisis: Might be caused by the OS trying to boot to Fluxbox 
     (as is default for no currently understood reason), and Fluxbox 
     is returning an error.
Notes: To avoid this bug, go into LightDM's desktop selection, and 
     click Lumina, it will auto-boot into it without any password, 
     and the OS should work like normal.
